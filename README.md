# Housing Prices Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze housing price data to identify key factors affecting house prices and to develop a predictive model to estimate property prices based on various attributes. The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Data Acquisition
- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Data Exploration
Initial inspection of the dataset includes checking the shape, column names, and descriptive statistics.

## Data Cleaning
In this phase, we identify and handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types. Important steps include:

- Identifying missing data and visualizing it
- Handling missing values according to defined strategies
- Removing duplicate entries
- Converting categorical features to appropriate data types

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The goal of EDA is to visually and statistically analyze the dataset to summarize its main characteristics. Key activities include:

- Analyzing the distribution of key variables
- Investigating relationships between features
- Identifying potential outliers through visualizations

## Reporting Findings
We summarize key insights derived from the EDA, such as:

- **Distribution of Lot Area**: Observations about the skewness of lot sizes.
- **Correlation Insights**: Findings about significant correlations between key features.
- **Feature Relationships**: Insights on how living area and overall quality contribute to housing prices.

## Conclusion and Future Work
This analysis reveals that certain features, particularly 'OverallQual', 'GrLivArea', and 'Neighborhood', play significant roles in determining home values. Future work could focus on building predictive models using these findings to enhance property price estimations.
